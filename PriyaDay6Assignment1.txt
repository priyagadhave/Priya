                     Repetition Practice Problems with for loop

1.Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a table of the
  powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n.

Answer-
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a base number:"
read base
echo  "Enter a exponential number:"
read exp
power=1
for (( counter=$exp; counter!=0; counter-- ))
do
    power=$(($power*$base))

done
echo $power

2. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints the nth harmonic
   number.

Answer-
#!/bin/bash -x
read -p "enter a number: " n
harmonic=0
for (( i=1; i<=n; i++))
do
harmonic=`echo "scale=2;$harmonic+(1/$i)" | bc`
done

3.Write a program that takes a input and determines if the number is a prime.
Answer-

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number"
read number
result=1

for ((  counter=2; counter<$number; counter++ ))
do
    if  [  $(($number%$counter))  -eq 0 ]
    then
        result=$(($result+1))
    fi
done
if [  $result -eq 1 ]
then
  echo "its a prime number"
else
  echo "its not a prime number"
fi

4.Extend the program to take a range of number as input and output the Prime
  Numbers in that range.
Answer-

#!/bin/bash
echo  "Enter a first number:"
read number1
echo  "Enter a second number:"
read number2

for (( counter1=number1;  counter1<number2; counter1++ ))
do
    result=1
   for (( counter2=2; counter2<counter1; counter2++ ))
   do
     if [ $(($counter1%$counter2))  -eq 0 ]
     then
         result=$(($result+1))
     fi
    done

     if [ $result -eq 1 ]
        then
        echo "Prime numbers between range is :$counter1"
     fi
done

5.Write a program that computes a factorial of a number taken as input.5
  Factorial â€“ 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
Answer-

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read number1
result=1

for (( number=1; number<=$number1; number++ ))
do

    result=$(( $result*$number ))
done

echo " factorial of a  number is:$result"

6.Write a program to compute Factors of a number N using prime factorization method.
  Logic -> Traverse till i*i <= N instead of i <= N for efficiency.
  O/P -> Print the prime factors of number N.

Answer-

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a Number:"
read number

for (( counter=2;  counter<$number;  counter++ ))
do

   while [  $(($number%$counter)) -eq 0 ]
   do

      echo "$counter "
      number=$(($number/$counter))
      done
done

if [  $number -gt 2 ]
then
      echo "$number"
fi
